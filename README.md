# Tooth Truth

This project was created as part of the 'Data Visualisation Techniques' course during the third semester of my studies at Warsaw University of Technology.
Our poster focuses on oral health and aims to explore global disparities in access to essential resources for maintaining good oral hygiene.

### Project Overview

In our analysis, we first examined the number of dentists (per 10,000 people) and the amount of time it takes to afford a year’s supply of toothpaste. Following this, we analyzed the global distribution of toothlessness to identify patterns and regional differences in oral health. Finally, we investigated sugar consumption levels across continents and explored how these relate to our earlier findings on oral health.
